# Pathfinding Visualizer

Hi there, thanks for checking this out. This is a pathfinding visualizer that I made with React and although it's not really complete in my eyes, I'm proud of it and I'm happy to share it with you.


## Algorithms Implemented
- Dijkstra's Algorithms
- A* Algorithms
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search

An algorithm for randomizing a maze is also implemented. (**My favorite feature**)

- You can play around with the app [here]()
